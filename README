1) you must have python and node js in your system
python: https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3114/
node js: https://nodejs.org/en/download/current

2) put your api key in api.js file, I have used the free one.

3) run npm i before running the code

4) remember you downloaded the python just run this command in command prompt
    pip install --upgrade openai openai"[datalib]"

5) i have stored your data in data.jsonl file in jsonl format ( that open ai accepts)

6) now open the terminal in root folder and run this
    openai tools fine_tunes.prepare_data -f ./data.jsonl

7) this will fine tune your data and create a new file data_prepared.jsonl, you can try this by deleting the current data_prepared.jsonl file.

8) if you have any changes in data change data.jsonl file

9) when data is ready run this command
    node uploadFile.js

10) it will upload data.jsonl and provide you the file id, store that file id somewhere

11) now goto createFineTune.js file and replace the file id there.

12) you can check your request of fine tuning by running this command
        node listFineTunes.js

13) once the output says succeeded run this command to check either modal has trained or not
        node createCompletion.js

NOTES: 
1) make your data more expressable for example instead of saying "Do you offer free shipping?" you can write 
"Do "FLEET OR WHATEVER YOUR NAME IS" offer free shipping?" so the gpt knows it taking about you.

2) make sure to enter more data to get more fine results according to open ai it self you can use 500 lines of data to get good results.
